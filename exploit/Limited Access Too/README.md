The `.htaccess` file limits these HTTP methods: `GET POST HEAD PUT DELETE CONNECT OPTIONS`, so we need to use other methods to solve the problem. We use PATCH this time.

Run this to solve the problem:
`curl -X PATCH --cookie "your_cookie_here" http://www.wechall.net/challenge/wannabe7331/limited_access_too/protected/protected.php`
