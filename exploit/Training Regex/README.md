you have to know basic regex before reading this writeup

###Level 1
the problem says you need to write a regexp that matches an **empty** string, and **only** an empty string

this is simple, give it `/^$/` and you're done for level 1

###Level 2
simple too, do `/^wechall$/`

###Level 3
we see that we need to write a regexp matches, for example, `wechall4.tiff, wechall.png, wechall4.jpg, wechall.bmp`

so we cut the pattern into three parts:

* the first part: match `wechall` or `wechall4`
* the second part: match `.`
* the third part: match `jpg`, `gif`, `tiff`, `bmp` or `png`

so the full regexp is: `/^wechall4?\.(?:jpg|gif|tiff|bmp|png)$/`.

`^` means the start of matching, `wechall` means match `wechall` obviously. `4?` means match `4` or just nothing, so it accepts `wechall` or `wechall4`. this is the first part.

`\.` means matching `.`. `\` is for escaping. this is the second part.

`(?:jpg|gif|tiff|bmp|png)` means match `jpg`, `gif`, `tiff`, `bmp` or `png`. `?:` is for making this as a non-capture group, which the problem asks us to do it. `$` means the end of the matching. this is the third part.

###Level 4
capture the filename, without extension  
As an example: wechall4.jpg should capture/return wechall4 in your pattern now.

alright this is fucking easy, just do `/^(wechall4?)\.(?:jpg|gif|tiff|bmp|png)$/`.
