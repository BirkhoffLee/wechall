first we open http://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/programming1/index.php?action=request and see what happens. every time we open it, it gives us a different "code".

according to the problem, it asks us to pass the code to it within 1.337 seconds after opening that url. so we need to write a simple script for us to accomplish this. we will do this using AJAX technology

open your browser's console, the website has already loaded jQuery, so just type the following to your console, press enter and you're done

```
$.ajax({url:"http://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/programming1/index.php?action=request"}).done(function(x){window.open("http://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/programming1/index.php?answer="+x)})
```

answer: run the code above in your browser
