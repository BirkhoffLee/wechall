line 14, the script make EVERY get variable into a var like if I open `globals.php?foo=bar`, the script will declare a variable called `foo`, assigned with `bar`

line 35, again, the admin's username is `admin`. we need to make `$login[0]` in order to execute line 36 `$chall->onChallengeSolved(GWF_Session::getUserID());`.

so we just pass a GET variable called `login[]` into it and its value is `admin`, this makes the script initalize a array var called `login` and set the value of first element of it to `admin`
